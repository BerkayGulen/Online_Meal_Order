# Online Meal Order
This projectâ€™s goal is create an online meal-order simulation that provides ordering at home instead of 
going a restaurant or food company. In this study, two different perspectives are determined. These are 
perspective of the customer who gives an order and perspective of the catering company that takes an 
order.
